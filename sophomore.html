		<p> Like a star forming from a nebula, my knowledge on physics and the professional workforce has began to manifest. In these next few years I hope to continue to expand my knowledge and really apply everything I've retained. </p>

		<h2 id="h2"> Fall 2021 </h2>
		<p>The first semester I got a 4.0 GPA and was a awarded with the presdiental honors roll and for spring I also did well and was able to be on the Dean's list. This year was very enjoyable because I was able to find a couple of clubs to connect with like Astronomy Club and Knight Hacks@UCF. </p>

		<p>As a physics major, I was always interested in the intersection of physics and computer science, so I decided to pursue a minor in computer science. In the Fall 2021 semester, I enrolled in Intro to C, which was the perfect introduction to programming for someone with little to no prior experience in computer science. I learned how to write basic programs, create functions, and manipulate data structures. As a physics major, I found that the skills I gained in Intro to C were immediately applicable to my physics coursework. I could use programming to model and analyze physical systems, which greatly expanded my understanding of the subject. </p> 

		<h2 id="h2"> Spring 2022 </h2>
		<p> I continued my studies in computer science by taking Computer Science 1. This course built upon the programming concepts that I learned in Intro to C and focused on more complex algorithms and data structures. As a physics major, I found that the problem-solving skills I gained in this course were particularly valuable. I learned how to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable pieces, which allowed me to tackle challenging physics problems with greater ease. Overall, my experience with these courses has been incredibly rewarding, and I'm excited to continue exploring the intersection of physics and computer science in my future coursework. </p>

		<h2 id="h2"> Fall 2022 </h2>
		<p>I completed the first semester of sophomore year in a good standing while getting almost all A's and an A-. I participated in a lot more clubs and volunteering activites. The second semester was rough for me because I was taking five classes. </p>
		<br></br>

		<h2 id="h2"> Spring 2023 </h2>
		<p>Fortunately, I was able to pass all my classes but I was not satisfied with my performance for that spring. This semester ignited my interest in python because I saw that it is utilized when creating physics programs and data science. I will strive to do better in the summer and the following semesters. </p>

		<h2 id="h2"> Sophomore Club Activities </h2>
		
		<p id="volunteering"> I helped volunteer for the Astronomy Club at UCF and was able to volunteer for Knights under the stars. I was able to educate kids and other college students on the parts of a telescope and what was out in the sky at the time. Here are some pictures from the event.</p>

		<p> I also participated in HackADay by Knight Hacks@UCF, where we created the front end of an app that was like duolingo but for learning anything and it would utilize an AI to better understand how to present information to people depending on their preferred learning style. </p>
		<p>I was also part of a project for Society of Phyiscs Students called the Marsh White Outreach project. We went to a local elementary school and taught kids about circuits and the phyiscs behind them. Furthermore, we demonstrated electricity in mini-circuits and explained the different applications of circuits in real life. </p>

		<h2 id="h2"> Summer 2023 </h2>
    	<p>My summer was very exciting because I was able to start my research in planetary astronomy and finish my outreach project with SPS. In this outreach project we visited an elementary school and taught them about electricity, circuits and the physics related to them. At our event, we set up four interactive stations, each dedicated to different facets of electricity. One station delved into the intriguing effects of water and saltwater on circuits. I personally led a station focused on insulators and conductors, imparting knowledge about their roles in circuits and how they function – or don't function – within the circuitry.
