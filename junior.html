    <p class="freshText" style= "text-shadow:2px 2px 0 #444";>My summer was very exciting because I was able to start my research in planetary astronomy and finish my outreach project with SPS. In this outreach project we visited an elementary school and taught them about electricity, circuits and the physics related to them. We had four different stations where we focused on teaching them about various aspects of elecricity for example we had one where we focused on how water and salt water effects a circuit. I did my station on insulators and conductors to teach the kids about what counted as an insulator and conductor and how they worked or didn't work in a circuit. </p>


    <p class="freshText" style= "text-shadow:2px 2px 0 #444";>I started my research under two professor each completely unique in there own right. One was a programming project where we used Anaconda and picaso with a stellar database to create atmospheres of exoplanets. The other one was more lab ortiented and I worked under a post-doc student who taught me about taking the spectra of moon and asteriod simulants. We would combine various minerials to try to get it exactly like one part of the surface of the moon. </p>
